Hey! If you're reading this you have some interest in who I am or what this site is all about. By the end of this article, I hope to give you a complete picture of both. Let's get started with the former.  

### Early Studies + Undergrad 
First, an introduction. My name is Ben and I'm a Software Engineer.

My first introduction to Computer Science was in high school, where in AP CS I got a crash course in the basics of computer science for use in mathematics and coding problems. I enjoyed this course and the methods of computational thinking that I learned here enough to make the decision to major in CS.

I studied at Northeastern University for undergrad where I learned about classical computer science and systems. During undergrad I built a strong foundation of software engineering and computer science skills. 

Throughout my courses I built a large portion of a modern computing stack and gained a strong understanding of crucial concepts:  

- In Computer Organization, I built an 8-bit processor and all supporting circuits capable of running MIPS assembly programs giving me a strong understanding of exactly how computers work and how bits flow through the wire. 
- In Computer Systems, I built a shell supporting a subset of bash instructions and read the entire source for Unix, informing my knowledge of how operating systems and OS level operations work. 
- In Computer Networks, I built a TCP/IP frame encoding/decoding stack which I used in a custom distributed DNS and CDN service that I built and deployed globally, giving me experience in both distributed systems and efficient computer networking. 
- In Programming Languages, I built a simple functional programming language, teaching me a ton about lexing, parsing, and evaluation semantics.
- In Graph Systems and Analytics, I went deep into graph-based architectures, experimenting with Spark/Map-Reduce and enhancing a unique graph mining algorithm (UNOT).
- Through Mathematics of Data Models, Linear Algebra, I gained a strong understanding of the mathematics behind machine learning techniques.

Co-op is a big portion of the educational experience at Northeastern, for me doubly so. During my sophomore year at Northeastern I started applying for my first co-op. I ended up securing a Software Engineering Co-op position at Running Tide, a post Series-B, nature-based carbon removal startup. This opportunity proved fruitful, not only did I work here for the duration of my 6 month co-op, but also through the remainder of my undergrad and graduate programs. 

### Graduate Studies

During my undergraduate degree at Northeastern, I took graduate courses in place of undergraduate ones to gain progress on a Master's Degree. Through the course of my graduate program I completed several end-to-end software projects, learned core software engineering best practices, practices cutting edge machine learning and computer vision techniques, and overall rounded out my software engineering skillset. Specifically, I completed several polished software projects.

- In Web Development, I created a Secret Santa application that allowed users to join gift giving groups, wishlist items, give gifts, and showcase their generosity. I leveraged TypeScript, MongoDB, React, and NextJS to create and host this application while leverage best practices for testing and CI/CD.
- In Software Engineering, I collaborated on a team to create a networked drawing application using D, a C-like language that provides guarantees around memory safety. In addition to simply learning this language, we developed an application with near complete testing coverage, a comprehensive GitHub Actions based CI/CD pipeline, and efficient socket based networking. With this project, I also had the unique opportunity to present on my experience learning D at DConf '23 in London.
- In Machine Learning, I implemented a data pipeline and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for retina disease detection. Using k-fold cross validation our model acheived a solid 97% accuracy.
- In Computer Networks, I implemented a web crawler from scratch, implementing session capabilities and circular URL detection. 
- In Data Mining and Large Scale Processing, I implemented a gunshot detection model using a CNN. By converting audio files into their Mel Spectrogram, we can gain insight into the power and cadence of gunshots in the form of spatial data, lending itself well to the convolutional model.

Throughout my graduate degree, experiential learning proved to be incredibly powerful. I gained hands on experience building professional-grade projects in a collaborative environment, an environment I find to be remarkably similar to a professional software engineering environment.

### Early Employment

Earlier, I mentioned my co-op position at Running Tide. This position stayed with me long after my co-op completion. From my sophomore year to the present day, I've worked full-time at Running Tide. 

Running Tide is a nature-based carbon removal company. What does that mean? At Running Tide, we leverage the ocean to store carbon at geologic scales. In practice, this means that we deploy biomass into the deep ocean where it grows macroalgae. Eventually, it becomes negatively buoyant and sinks below 1,000 meters, where it is stored durably at geologic timescales. 

Due to the nature of our interventions, it is critical to physically verify their efficacy. At Running Tide I develop portions of this verification system. Specifically, I've worked on writing firmware for our offshore buoys, developed web software for fleet management and data reception, implemented AI data pipelines for machine vision systems, created hardware systems to simulate offshore data, and much more. 

### Familiar Technologies

Throughout my studies and career, I've gained experience in a variety of languages and technologies. I've implemented projects or parts of projects in C, C++, D, Java, Racket, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, MIPS Assembly, Verilog, C#, and Bash. I've worked with Postgres, MongoDB, GraphQL, Express, Node, React, Flask, Django, Fast, OpenAPI, Dub, Git, Balena, Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, REST APIs, Balena, Socket.IO, CircleCI, and many more.

### This Site

On this site, I hope to explore more of what can be enabled by software. Here, I hope to host an array of unique, small software demos that I've built. For example, I've already posted a small blog on cellular automata and one of the more famous computer science problems: [Conway's Game of Life](/blog/conway). Additionally, I plan to write on larger scoped projects that I've taken on, like building a reef tank control system, and any other thoughts that I might want to put to words.

I hope you enjoy the site. If you'd like to reach out, head over to the [contact page](/contact).
